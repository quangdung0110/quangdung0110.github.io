My full name is Huy Minh Nguyen, and I am currently working at [VinAI Research, Vietnam](http://www.vinai.io) as an AI Reseach Resident under the supervision of [Prof. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). Before joining VinAI Research, I studied at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, University of Science and then graduated as a valedictorian of this university with a GPA of 9.75/10.0 (~ 3.93/4.0) in 2020. 

Here is the latest version of my resume: [[CV](https://huynm99.github.io/CV_HuyNguyen.pdf)]

## Research Interests 
My current research focuses mainly on Optimal Transport theory, in which I utilize various techniques to lower the computational complexity of Optimal Transport algorithms. Additionally, I am also interested in developing a theoretical understanding of Wasserstein distance and its variants between common distributions, particularly Gaussians. On the application side, I have recently used Optimal Transport to study the label shift and data shift problems in Domain Adaptation.
