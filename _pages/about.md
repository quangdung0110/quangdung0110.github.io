My full name is Huy Minh Nguyen, and I am currently working at [VinAI Research, Vietnam](http://www.vinai.io) as an AI Reseach Resident under the supervision of [Prof. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). Before joining VinAI Research, I studied at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, University of Science and then graduated as a valedictorian of this university with a GPA of 9.75/10.0 in 2020.
