Welcome to my homepage! My full name is Quang Dung Le (in Vietnamese: Lê Quang Dũng, in Chinese: 黎光勇) and I am a second-year *Ingénieur* student (Master's level) at the [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu). Before that, I graduated from the Department of Mathematics, Mechanics, and Informatics, VNU University of Science, Ha Noi

## Research Interests 
My current research focuses mainly on Optimal Transport theory, in which I utilize various techniques to lower the computational complexity of Optimal Transport algorithms. Additionally, I am also interested in Mixture Models and its applications in Deep Learning.
## Recent News
- **[Oct 2022]** Two new papers about Sliced-Wasserstein distance are out! See more at [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10268) and [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13570).
- **[May 2022]** Our paper "[Entropic Gromov-Wasserstein between Gaussian Distributions](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/le22a.html)" is accepted to ICML 2022.
- **[Feb 2022]** I am awarded the Doctoral Fellowship of the University of Texas at Austin.
- **[Jan 2022]** Our paper "[On Multimarginal Partial Optimal Transport: Equivalent Forms and Computational Complexity](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/le22a.html)" is accepted to AISTATS 2022.
