Welcome to my homepage! My full name is Quang Dung Le (in Vietnamese: Lê Quang Dũng, in Chinese: 黎光勇) and I am a second-year *Ingénieur* student (Master's level) at the [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu).  I am currently doing research under the guidance of Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/index.html). Before that, I graduated from the Department of Mathematics, Mechanics, and Informatics, VNU University of Science, Ha Noi

## Research Interests 
My current research focuses mainly on Optimal Transport theory, in which I utilize various techniques to lower the computational complexity of Optimal Transport algorithms. Additionally, I am also interested the application of Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing. 
## Recent News
- **[May 2022]** Our paper "[Entropic Gromov-Wasserstein between Gaussian Distributions](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/le22a.html)" is accepted to ICML 2022.
