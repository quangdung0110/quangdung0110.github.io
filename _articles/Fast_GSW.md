Abstract: Generalized sliced Wasserstein distance is a variant of sliced Wasserstein distance
that exploits the power of non-linear projection through a given defining function to
better capture the complex structures of the probability distributions. Similar to sliced
Wasserstein distance, generalized sliced Wasserstein is defined as an expectation over
random projections which can be approximated by the Monte Carlo method. However, the
complexity of that approximation can be expensive in high-dimensional settings. To that
end, we propose to form deterministic and fast approximations of the generalized sliced
Wasserstein distance by using the concentration of random projections when the defining
functions are polynomial function, circular function, and neural network type function.
Our approximations hinge upon an important result that one-dimensional projections of a
high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
